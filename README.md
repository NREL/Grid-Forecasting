## Requirements

1. Docker ce version 17.12 or better.  You can install this via the docker_install_ubuntu.sh script.  (note for mint you will need to modify the file to work with xenial rather than ubuntu generically)

## Quick Start

1. Please clone the repository <https://github.com/GRIDAPPSD/gridappsd-docker> (refered to as gridappsd-docker repository) next to this repository (they should both have the same parent folder)

    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/GRIDAPPSD/gridappsd-docker
    git clone https://github.com/GRIDAPPSD/Grid-Forecasting
    
    ls -l
    
    drwxrwxr-x  7 osboxes osboxes 4096 Sep  4 14:56 gridappsd-docker
    drwxrwxr-x  5 osboxes osboxes 4096 Sep  4 19:06 Grid-Forecasting

    ```

## Creating the sample-app application container

1.  From the command line execute the following commands to build the sample-app container

    ```console
    osboxes@osboxes> cd Grid-Forecasting
    osboxes@osboxes> docker build --network=host -t grid-forecasting-app .
    ```

1.  Add the following to the gridappsd-docker/docker-compose.yml file
Add 9003 to the ports in the docker-compose.yml allows for data to be sent to the bokeh streaming tool. 
```yaml
  grid_forecasting:
    image: grid-forecasting-app
    ports:
      - 9003:9003
    environment:
      GRIDAPPSD_URI: tcp://gridappsd:61613
    depends_on:
      - gridappsd
    volumes:
      - $HOME/git/adms/Grid-Forecasting-Public:/usr/src/gridappsd-grid-forecasting
```

1.  Run the docker application 

    ```` console
    osboxes@osboxes> cd gridappsd-docker
    osboxes@osboxes> ./run.sh
    
    # you will now be inside the container, the following starts gridappsd
    
    gridappsd@f4ede7dacb7d:/gridappsd$ ./run-gridappsd.sh
    
    ````

Next to start the application through the viz follow the directions here: https://gridappsd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_gridappsd/index.html#start-gridapps-d-platform
